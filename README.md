This project takes my name (Janvier Mbilizi) as it is designed to show case my work.

As a web developer, I want a deployed portfolio so that I can showcase my applications to potential employers and clients. It is in that spirit that my instructor gave me and other students a homework to design our personal website that will showcase our work.

I used HTML, CSS (in Video Studio Code) and Bootstrap, React, node, express and nodemailer . And of cause Git/Github was used as version control and heroku for deployment.

<strong>Installation </strong>

This is only a website and does not need installation. it is currently hosted in github and you can access it at https://janviermbilizi.herokuapp.com/
